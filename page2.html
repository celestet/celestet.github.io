        <p style="text-align:center">Band Website</p>
        <p>This band website was to pretend to create a website for your own named band. We used bootstrap, HTML and CSS. We also used flexbox. The album covers and merch were designed with a website. The titles of the band website were thought by whatever word came in my head. I named the page elecoustics because that was one of the names that my friends thought of when we were creating our band. Click the picture to go to the website. </p>
