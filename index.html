        <p>I am a junior at Pasadena High School. I am currently in App Academy learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. Being in the pathway got me interested in majoring in Computer Science, maybe software development or software engineering. I have also been in a small summer class where I learned a bit of Python and Java. In that class, we tried to use Java to create an Android App so that made me interested in software. I enjoy listening to music, <a class="intro" href="page4.html" target="_blank">playing viola, guitar and keyboard, practicing Shaolin Kungfu and speech and debate.(click to learn more) </a></p>
